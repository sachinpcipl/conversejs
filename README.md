Generating a plugin with Yeoman

The rest of this document explains how to write a plugin for Converse and ends with a documented example of a plugin.

There is a Yeoman code generator, called generator-conversejs, which you can use to generate plugin scaffolding/boilerplate that serves as a starting point and basis for writing your plugin.

Please refer to the [generator-conversejs](https://github.com/conversejs/generator-conversejs) README for information on how to use it.
